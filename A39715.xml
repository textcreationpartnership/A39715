            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>THere is as much difference betwixt <hi>Raillerie</hi> and <hi>Satyrs, Jesting</hi> and <hi>Jeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</hi> as betwixt <hi>gallantry</hi> and <hi>clow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishnesse;</hi> or betwixt a <hi>gentle Accost</hi> and <hi>rude Assault.</hi> And if I would habit them in their several properties, I would cloath <hi>Satyr</hi> in hair-cloath, <hi>jeering</hi> in home spun-stuff, <hi>jesting</hi> in motley, and <hi>Raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> in silk. It being a gentle exercise of wit and witty harmlesse <hi>calumny,</hi> speaks ill of you by contraries; and the <hi>reverse</hi> or tother side of complement, as far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath as that above reality. There's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it of abusive, and only as much in it of handsome invective and reproach as may well be owned without a blush: publishing those praises of you without shame, which flattery would make you ashamed to hear. It differs from <hi>Gybing</hi> as gentle smiles from scornfull laughter, and from raylingas Gentlemens playing at foyls, from Butchers and Clowns play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Cudgels. Tis nothing bitter, but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109044:19"/> a poignant sauce of wit, for curious pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, not for your vulgar Tasts. And as <hi>Barriers, Justs</hi> and <hi>Tournment</hi> a sport one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for your nobler sort; somewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling earnest, and which indeed, none should use, but those who know to make a sport of it: your Northern Nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most commonly unhappy in this, that when their wits fall short, they piece it out with choller, and the blunter their wits are, the sharper are their weapons still. In fine, tis a plant grows more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally in your <hi>Southern</hi> Regions, and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome farther North than <hi>Paris</hi> yet: Whence whilest the <hi>French</hi> would have transplanted it with their others fashions into <hi>England,</hi> like those who first brought in <hi>Tobacco,</hi> they had but the Curses of the common People for their pains; they understanding <hi>railing</hi> far better than <hi>Raillerie:</hi> much of the nature of those Beasts who cannot play, but they must fall to scratching and biting strait, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore till they understand it better, 'Ile say no more of it, but leave it as a Riddle to them still amongst the rest.</p>

               <p>YOur <hi>Complementer</hi> is a <hi>French</hi> famil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that came not in with the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,</hi> but the <hi>corruption</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known unto our honest Ancestors, who did as they said, and spoke as they meant; he is the rack of <hi>conversation,</hi> and sets e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ones joints a stretching: And in <hi>France</hi> he derives his pedegree from an <hi>accomply menteur</hi> or an <hi>accomplisht lyer:</hi> for <hi>complement</hi> is worse than <hi>equivocation,</hi> since that has alwayes some mentall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation or lurking hole for <hi>truth,</hi> but this has none. Tis the language of <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boly,</hi> and sometimes of <hi>Irony;</hi> tis the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Court,</hi> where <hi>meaning</hi> walks for pomp and shew, with a long train of words; and that the <hi>Courtier</hi> uses, to <hi>bob</hi> of suiters, or <hi>bob</hi> for those they are suiters too: In a word, tis the language of the <hi>Idle</hi> for to delight the <hi>vain,</hi> and but
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:109044:73"/> a speaking <hi>ceremony,</hi> as <hi>ceremony</hi> is but a dumb <hi>complement;</hi> whence our new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers hate it so much perhaps, as they have chang'd the stile into as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Civility, as t'other was in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, they being faln now upon such a vain of <hi>clownishness</hi> (or I may say) not <hi>bluntnesse,</hi> but <hi>churlishnesse,</hi> not of plain <hi>dealing,</hi> but of plain <hi>divillishness,</hi> as if they hold on as they begin, pray <hi>God</hi> we do not wish for our complimenting dayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as far the better extremity of the two.</p>

                  <hi>CHARACTER.</hi> Of a young Enamourist.</head>
               <p>He's one who as soon as he has quited his School-boyes <hi>Toyes,</hi> next <hi>Toy</hi> he gets is a Mrs when t'would make you forswear <hi>Love</hi> to see how ridiculously he makes it, and to hear him talk of <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Goddesses,</hi> you would take him for some <hi>Pagan</hi> never converted to <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> There is nothing so <hi>cold</hi> as to hear him talk of Flames, nor so <hi>dull</hi> as his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing of <hi>Cupids</hi> darts, and to hear him <hi>sigh</hi> like a dry <hi>Pump,</hi> or broken <hi>winded bellows;</hi> you would neer wonder at <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Witches</hi> affording winds so cheap. Of all servants he is the necessariest and easiest to content and feed, for he is his Mrs. <hi>Squire, Dispenser, Laquey</hi> or <hi>Messenger,</hi> but above all her <hi>Fool,</hi> to which he is bound, by the proverb; <hi>Tis impossible to love and to be wise:</hi> Mean time, you may feed him cheaper than a <hi>Chamelion,</hi> for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:109044:74"/> a good look serves him a week at least, and he is prouder of holding his Mrs. <hi>Busque</hi> or <hi>Fan,</hi> than a <hi>School Boy</hi> with a Scepter in his hand, playing the <hi>Emperors</hi> part ith School; to keep him to which, his Mrs. lets him know that tis with <hi>Love</hi> as tis with <hi>War,</hi> which once declared you are to expect nothing but <hi>Hostility;</hi> and knows her self, that tis with Lovers as tis with <hi>Anglers,</hi> who feed the Fish ere they are caught, but caught once feed on them: Whence she bites not greedily at the bait, but craftily tolls him on with <hi>hopes,</hi> &amp; like <hi>Rope makers</hi> gos backwards still, the better to advance her work, and draw him on, mean while he follows her so long, till either he wax weary and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses his persuit, or catches her tripping, and then fals down on her, when fasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her in the marriage nooz, he carries her away, and either turns kind <hi>Cuckold,</hi> and keeps open house for all, or jealous <hi>Coxcomb</hi> and shuts his doores against e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one.</p>
